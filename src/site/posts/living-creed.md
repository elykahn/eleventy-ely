### Good Life Project "Living Creed"

don't try to be different,
own the fact you already are. 
be fierce with your time. but
generous with your heart.
presence, not presents. 
the biggest wall you've gotta climb is the one you build in your mind, 
you don't need a hammer to knock it down, just the will to act.
find awe, let it shake you, melt you, lift you, then share it.
ritualize the mundane to make room for the brilliant.
have a strategy, but be open to serendipity, 
the best things in life are rarely planned. 
life is a story, if you wouldn't read the one you're telling,
write a different ending.
genius begins with a burning question, what's yours?
you will never have perfect information, act anyway.
it's more important to choose than to choose right.
don't confuse genuine peace of mind with the passing lack of angst that follows the demise of a dream but precedes a mounting wave of regret. 
easy is not always right.
embrace the thrash. 
uncertainty is a signpost of possibility.
when you align what you do with who you are,
you'll become what you need to be.
build a tribe, people matter.
love so deeply it cracks open the world. 
hug people hello, then hold on to the ones who don't run for the hills.
serve others, but don't live your life through them.
expose your soul, vulnerability is a gateway to strength.
//////// pause often. listen deeply.
move your body, feed your brain.
lighten up, if you can't laugh at yourself, others will happily do it for you.
the quest to create something from nothing is a wholly irrational act,
do it anyway. 
lean into the abyss, do the thing that scares you most.
create. don't replicate.
failure is only failure when it doesn't move you forward.
choose gratitude over greed.
a good life isn't a place at which you arrive, 
it is a lens through which you see and create your world.
rise up. be your own guru.
this is the big show.
make meaning.
