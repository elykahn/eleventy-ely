### Lawrence
#### Don't Lose Sight (Acoustic)  

> This energetic anthem might not find its place in your heart on the first listen, but mark my word, it's catchy refrain performed by an eclectic cohort of outstanding vocalists and accompanied by smoothly up-tempo instrumentation is sure to draw you back in and by the time you're singing 'Don't Lose Sight, Baby, Don't Lose Sight' to yourself as you stroll down the street, lifting your arms too the rhythm so you can gesture emotively as lead singer Gracie Lawrence belts out her empowered, soulful retorts, "They say its gonna get me but I won't let it" to the defeated "This shit ain't ever gonna change..." is uplifting and mournful, compassionate and cheerful.

Don't lose sight
<p class="poetry">
Are you kidding me?
I'm getting sick of the industry
I've had enough of the make believe
Oh please, oh please
Am I lost or found?
I'm getting sick of the ups and downs
No need to give me the run around
I'm out, I'm out

This shit's going to kill me
But I won't let it
And I try to give them hell
But they don't get it
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight
Baby don't lose sight

And they try to get me up
But I won't give in
And this light will get you down
But I keep living
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight
Baby don't lose sight

Don't lose sight
Baby don't lose sight

Are you kidding me?
I'm getting sick of the in between
Running in place isn't interesting
To me, to me
Am I good enough?
Does that even matter
Or is it luck
I'm checking the prices on giving up
Now what, now what

This shit's going to kill me
But I won't let it
And I try to give them hell
But they don't get it
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight
Baby don't lose sight

And they try to get me up
But I won't give in
And this light will get you down
But I keep living
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight
Baby don't lose sight

Don't lose sight
Baby don't lose sight

Don't lose sight
Baby don't lose sight

And this shit ain't ever going to change
It ain't ever going to change
It ain't ever going to change
And this shit ain't ever going to change
It ain't ever going to change
It ain't ever going to change

This shit ain't ever going to change
(This shit's going to kill me, but I won't let it)
It ain't ever going to change
So I tell myself when I sleep at night

This shit's going to kill me
But I won't let it
And I try to give them hell
But they don't get it
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight
Baby don't lose sight

And they try to get me up
But I won't give in
And this light will get you down
But I keep living
So I tell myself when I sleep at night
Don't lose sight
Baby don't lose sight
