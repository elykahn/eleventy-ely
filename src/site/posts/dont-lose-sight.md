### Lawrence
#### Don't Lose Sight (Acoustic)  

> This energetic anthem might not find its place in your heart on the first listen, but mark my word, it's catchy refrain performed by an eclectic cohort of outstanding vocalists and accompanied by smoothly up-tempo instrumentation is sure to draw you back in and by the time you're singing 'Don't Lose Sight, Baby, Don't Lose Sight' to yourself as you stroll down the street, lifting your arms too the rhythm so you can gesture emotively as lead singer Gracie Lawrence belts out her empowered, soulful retorts, "They say its gonna get me but I won't let it" to the defeated "This shit ain't ever gonna change..." is uplifting and mournful, compassionate and cheerful.
