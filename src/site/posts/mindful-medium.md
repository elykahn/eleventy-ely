# Mindful Medium  

*"At Medium we expect people to be **authentic, inspired, and present**. People’s brains should be focused on **solving meaningful problems, with creative solutions,** **collaborating with others** who want the same."*

Medium brings mindfulness to interactions by using and building business practices that ask **people to be explicit and clear in their communication.** It is important to be mindful of what co-workers expect from one another by having an organizational structure that makes **roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities explicit.**

Mindfulness has been defined by author Jon Kabat-Zinn as *“Paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally.” *Practicing mindfulness in its various forms, leads to an open mind. ***Open-minded people are receptive to new ideas, new people, and new ways of collaborating.** If you have an open mind, in a positive environment, with great people, you’re going to be **engaged by both the work and your co-workers**. Not only that, you’re going to be a **pretty engaging person yourself**. The goal is to create positive feedback loops among individuals, as well as between the team and the work.*
