title: EFT Tapping
date: 2021-12-27

This is the first of a series of posts logging my progress with EFT Tapping, which I'll be performing three times a day and monitoring my pain and associated psychological, emotional and general feelings.

This will include (Nociceptive)[Related to pain] ratings of 0-10 with more specifics added on along the way.

In this, my first post, I'm journaling my starting point. Today I've been relatively busy so my mind hasn't been focused on the pain.

Pre-Tapping Pain: 5 (sub-scapula and about an inch radius outward from the surgical site)

Tapping: 7 Rounds

Post-Tapping Pain: 5 (first the pain focused more precisely around the site, then it dispersed around my ribcage and into my shouler and neck with very slight feeling into my head)
