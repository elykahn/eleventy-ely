The MINDful Manifesto
v 0.1.5


1. Transcends the Medium
2. Is aware of and speaks to the context of its existence.
3. Retains process-driven character.
4. Produces something greater than itself, either mechanically/physically or via personal transmission, dictation or interaction.
5. Crosses lines(I.e. boundaries, limitations, assumptions)
6. Creative/Innovative
7. Co-Creative/Collaborative: the product of more than 2 hands.
8. Connective, Bridges previous gaps(see 5)
9. Unfinished, forever a work in progress. The work is not ended upon display, this merely marks a new stage in the life of the project.

* this list is, by definition, unfinished and subject to change as it evolves alongside its creator. The acceptance of a self-critical, dynamic and responsive state could be considered #0 or #10 in the list, but I prefer to state it separately, for the sake of clarity.
