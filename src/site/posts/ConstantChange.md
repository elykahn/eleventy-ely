#### The Status Quo  (is changing)
In the modern Modus Operandi, employees are expected to inherit the beliefs of their superiors, to absorb them and act accordingly. This has become a central basis for a society that is fundamentally hierarchical. In recent years, with the rise of web culture and alternative corporate structures like [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), an alternative, disruptive and innovative work  has leveled the playing field, such that forward-thinking organizations value the beliefs of the individuals that comprise them.

Still there is hesitation amongst applicants and employees to reveal their core beliefs for fear of rejection and humiliation. This leads to internalized resentment and often leaves the most innovative and radical ideas out of the realm of deliberation, in turn reducing the voices of the conversation to those individuals that have no doubt in their opinion. History has shown that these doubtless opinions are frequently based in pure abstraction, faith and self-interest, but that they are voiced with such confidence that an audience seeking answers is wont to accept those opinions as fact.

Having contemplated this conundrum throughout my life, I've come to accept that my beliefs are in a constant state of flux, but I agree with Heraclitus that all substantive matter is constantly changing. What is true in this moment may very well be different in the next, but I think that awareness is the root of innovation and progress, so I'm opening my mouth to vocalize my beliefs and opening my mind to change them.

There are a few essential points that should be acknowledged in such an approach:
* No individual is omniscient.  
* Each unique experience leads to a unique perspective.  
* One must be willing to accept that his or her belief is only validated by debate and until it is challenged, it remains a personal opinion.  
* No single person has a monopoly on truth. Just as one's belief may be valid, it may also be completely false.  
* Knowledge and expertise give weight to those learned individuals, and while this should be recognized, their beliefs are still fallible.
* It is entirely possible that this very document is partially, or even completely untrue, but to the best of my knowledge, at this moment, this is what I believe.
