A Shockingly Analogue Nightlife  
=======  
Side A:   
---  
This shockingly analogue nightlife,
an Architectural masterpiece of ironic artichokes and she,
stoned and sporadically leaping over the sun,
takes an 8-track out of her bra, spins her critically aclaimed LP,
and thoughtfully exploits the predicament.

===
Side B:
---
Silently mass-producing 8-bit psychedelia,
sporadically whispering to a companion,
we whistle past as brain surgeons evacuate stone sculptures
of ticklish peacocks on display.
 
A shockingly analogue nightlife,
celebratory armadillos and tribal modulations,
less a crime than an emotion.
